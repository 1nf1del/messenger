# Messenger [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/paked/messenger?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/paked/messenger)

This is a Go library for making bots to be used on Facebook messenger. It is built on the [Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform). One of the main goals of the project is to implement it in an idiomatic and easy to use fashion.

## Tips

- Follow the [quickstart](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) guide for getting everything set up!
- You need a Facebook development app, and a Facebook page in order to build things.
- Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to tunnel your locally runnning bot so that Facebook can reach the webhook.

## Inspiration

Messenger takes design cues from:
